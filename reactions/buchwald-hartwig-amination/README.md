The transition structures are taken from [J. Org. Chem. 2014, 79, 24, 11961-11969](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jo501817m).

## Description

The original paper contains two transition states, TS[1-2] and TS[5-4],
corresponding to two reactions.

Original structures from the SI are in folder `orig`. The paper contains
additional transition states not included here.

The transition state calculations were performed using B3LYP/LACVP* with D3
dispersion, using Jaguar.
